# week-3-challenge

This is edited version of the week 3 challenge for the bootcamp.

Clicking on the "Add employee" button will prompt the user to add in a first name, last name and salary in that order.

It will the ask if the user wants to add more employees and will loop until the user clicks cancel on the continue confirm box.

The website will then display the inputs, sorted in last name alphabetical order. Checking the console, the user will see the inputs in a table, an average salary of employees and a picked random employee.
